This is the JSON data that you must use: {{ $json.toJsonString() }}

---

You MUST output ONE single JSON object with this exact shape and with VALID JSON syntax.
- Double quotes for all keys and string values.
- No trailing commas.
- No comments.
- No additional keys.

The JSON object MUST have exactly these keys:

{
  "relationship_depth_score": 0.0,
  "relationship_stage": "cold",
  "trajectory": "stable",
  "channel_engagement": {
    "active_channels": [],
    "channel_diversity_score": 0.0
  },
  "key_positive_signals": [
    {
      "type": "",
      "date": "",
      "description": ""
    }
  ],
  "key_negative_signals": [
    {
      "type": "",
      "date": "",
      "description": ""
    }
  ],
  "relationship_summary": ""
}

⚠️ CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT:
Your response must be PURE JSON only.
- NO markdown code blocks (no ```)
- NO text before or after the JSON
- Start with { and end with }
