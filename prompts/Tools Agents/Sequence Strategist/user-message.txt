This is the JSON data that you must use: {{ $json.toJsonString() }}

---

You MUST output ONE single JSON object with this exact shape and with VALID JSON syntax.
- Double quotes for all keys and string values.
- No trailing commas.
- No comments.
- No additional keys.

The JSON object MUST have exactly these keys:

{
  "agent_id": "sequence_strategist",
  "sequence_strategy": {
    "is_sequence": false,
    "sequence_type": "standalone",
    "reasoning": "",
    "total_touches": 1,
    "min_days_between_touches": 0,
    "cadence_days": 0,
    "touches": [],
    "exit_conditions": {
      "immediate": [],
      "end_of_sequence": []
    }
  }
}

⚠️ CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT:
Your response must be PURE JSON only.
- NO markdown code blocks (no ```)
- NO text before or after the JSON
- Start with { and end with }
