This is the JSON data that you must use: {{ $json.toJsonString() }}

CURRENT DATE/TIME REFERENCE (CRITICAL):
Today is: {{ $now.toISO() }}
Use this as your reference for ALL time calculations.

---

You MUST output ONE single JSON object with this exact shape and with VALID JSON syntax.
- Double quotes for all keys and string values.
- No trailing commas.
- No comments.
- No additional keys.

The JSON object MUST have exactly these keys:

{
  "agent_id": "timing_strategist",
  "recommended_timing": {
    "mode": "specific_datetime",
    "recommended_local_datetime": null,
    "wait_days": 0,
    "day_of_week": "",
    "local_hour_range": "",
    "timezone": "",
    "reason": ""
  },
  "backup_timing": {
    "day_of_week": "",
    "local_hour_range": "",
    "reason": ""
  },
  "patterns": {
    "best_days_of_week": [],
    "best_hour_ranges": [],
    "average_response_time_hours": null,
    "peak_engagement_comment": ""
  },
  "recommended_velocity": {
    "level": "high",
    "min_days_between_touches": 0,
    "comment": ""
  }
}

⚠️ CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT:
Your response must be PURE JSON only.
- NO markdown code blocks (no ```)
- NO text before or after the JSON
- Start with { and end with }
